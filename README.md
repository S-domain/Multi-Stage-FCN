# Multi-stage fully convolutional network for precise prostate segmentation in ultrasound images
Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed non-cutaneous malignant tumors and the sixth major cause of cancer-related death generally found in men globally. Automatic segmentation of prostate regions has a wide range of applications in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. It is challenging to extract powerful spatial features for precise prostate segmentation methods due to the wide variation in prostate size, shape, and histopathologic heterogeneity among patients. Most of the existing CNN-based architectures often produce unsatisfactory results and inaccurate boundaries in prostate segmentation, which are caused by inadequate discriminative feature maps and the limited amount of spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a novel deep learning technique called Multi-Stage FCN architecture for 2D prostate segmentation that captures more precise spatial information and accurate prostate boundaries. \href{https://www.onlineconverter.com/nifti-to-png}{online converter software}
